🚀 Ultrasonic distance sensing 🚀

I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on involving ultrasonic distance sensing using an AVR microcontroller! 🛠️

With the help of an ultrasonic sensor and an AVR microcontroller, I've developed a system capable of accurately measuring distances. Here's a breakdown of the project:

🔹 Hardware:
-Atmega 32.
-ultrasonic sensor .
-LCD.

🔹 Software:
-Timer --> ICU.
-LCD.
-Features efficient algorithms for distance calculation.
